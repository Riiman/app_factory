SECTION 3: GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY
================================================================================

Absolutely! Here’s a **detailed, actionable GTM strategy for VentureXit**, tailored for a bootstrapped early-stage launch targeting India's early-stage startup exits ecosystem.

---

## 1. Market Entry Strategy

**Initial Target Segment (ICP):**
- *Founders of early-stage tech/SaaS startups* seeking exits (<$10M valuation).
- *SME owners* with digital businesses in Tier-1 & Tier-2 cities.
- *Startup acquirers*: micro-PE funds, angel investors, corporate innovation teams.

**Geographic Focus & Expansion Plan:**
- **Phase 1 (0–6 months):** Metro and Tier-1 cities (Bangalore, Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Hyderabad).
- **Phase 2 (6–12 months):** Tier-2 cities (Pune, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Kochi), pan-India digital reach.
