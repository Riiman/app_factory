Inspired by global models like Acquire.com, VentureXit tailors the startup exit and acquisition process for India\u2019s fragmented ecosystem. The platform brings transparency to startup exits by automating valuation, due diligence, and deal flow matching. It connects verified sellers with qualified buyers\u2014ranging from corporates seeking strategic acquisitions to micro-PE investors looking for profitable opportunities. VentureXit is incubated by TurningIdeas Ventures, aligning with its mission of accelerating founder journeys from idea to exit. The platform will evolve into India\u2019s most trusted marketplace for startup M&A, providing data-driven insights, valuation tools, and access to legal and financial partners in one place."
