    "problem_statement": "any kind of digital assests from design files to softwares to webpages. the sellers will be mostly startups which are not in a very good shape or want to shut down. buyers can be anyone who wants to use those assets to build thier own companies or use those assest in the existing business. its more like merger and acquisation.",
    "who_experiences_problem": "a lot of startup like the ones who run out of funding or the ones whih are having come internal conflicts but have already build a lot of assest. this is an easy exit for them with some monetixzation when earlier they were not getting anything",
    "product_service_idea": "the valueation will be ai based valuation and matching will be done to qualified and potential buyers only. the startups will also be verified before then can put thier assest for sale. this is how we develope confidence of both buyers and sellers. escrow service will be given from a third party that will hold the money from the buyer till the assest are transfered and verified by the buyer. ",
    "how_solves_problem": "the seller signs in and gets verified by a third party. post verification the startups list thier assets and thats shown in the listings tab on the platform. buyers with verified funds who has shown interest in the type of assests can see these listing. if intrested the can chat with the seller for more information and decide the terms of enagagement. once thats done the buyer puts a buy request. the assests are then put in an escrow escrow account by the seller. the buyer also puts in the decided amount in the escrow once both parties complete this the assest are given to the buyer for verification and a timelimit is set for verification. once the verification is done by the buyer the amout is transferred from the escrow to the seller. this way the whole jpurney is completed on a single platform without having to go anywhere else.",
    "intended_users_customers": "startups as seller and large companies,funds and individuals as buyers",
    "main_competitors_alternatives": "yes there are a lot of M&A service providers but they are expensive and also work offline limting reach for the seller",
    "how_stands_out": "its ai based valuation and integrated flow from listing to fila transfer of assets make it unique also the verification process and lising to only potential buyer increases the probablityof sale and that too fast",
