Design Principles

Modular & Scope-Driven: The dashboard is divided into modules that align with the major pillars of a startup: Product, Business, Fundraising, and Marketing. This mirrors the Scope enum in your models.

Data-Driven: Every piece of information displayed is directly sourced from the database models you've defined.

Action-Oriented: The interface is designed not just to display information but to enable action. "Create," "Add," "Update," and "Link" buttons are placed contextually.

Contextual Actions: Core operational items like Task, Experiment, and Artifact are not just in a separate list; they can be created and viewed in the context of what they relate to (e.g., adding a "Pitch Deck" artifact directly to a "Seed Funding Round").

High-Level Dashboard Structure

The dashboard will have a persistent left-hand sidebar for main navigation and a main content area that updates based on the selection.

Global Elements:

Top Bar: Displays the Startup's name, current stage (Startup.current_stage), and a user profile dropdown (Settings, Logout).

Global "Create" Button: A prominent button (e.g., a + icon) in the top bar that opens a menu to create a new:

Task

Experiment

Artifact

This is for creating unlinked, general items.
